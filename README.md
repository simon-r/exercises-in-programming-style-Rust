# Exercises in programming style Rust

My solutions in *Rust* of the exercises from the book: Exercises in programming style [Cristina Videira Lopes]

## The exercise:
Given a text file we want to display a list sorted by word frequency where the number of characters is at least 2 and the frequency is greater than or equal than a given number N. We should make sure to normalize for capitalization and ignore stop words like "the", "for", etc. 

This exercicse differs from the original exercise where the first N words are listed.
